- [Dog Food Day](http://example.com/)
- **Hack data**:   
A technology start-up in California has recently been hacked, and their forensic engineers have grabbed valuable information, including information like session time, locations, wpm typing speed, etc, to identify how many hackers did it. The goal is to use SparkML to do this. ([Github](https://github.com/yaiza612/Big_data/tree/main/Clustering))
